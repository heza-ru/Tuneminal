# Demo Files Instructions

## Current Status
- `Kenshi Yonezu - IRIS OUT.mp3` - This is a real MP3 file and should work
- `demo_song.mp3` - This is currently a placeholder text file

## To Fix the Demo Song
1. Replace `demo_song.mp3` with an actual MP3 audio file
2. The corresponding lyrics file `demo_song.lrc` is already properly formatted
3. Make sure the MP3 file is not corrupted and plays in other media players

## Testing the App
1. The app will work with the Kenshi Yonezu song (real MP3 file)
2. For the demo song, the app will fall back to simulation mode if the MP3 is invalid
3. The simulation mode still shows all the UI features including lyrics, visualizer, and controls

## Audio File Requirements
- Format: MP3 or WAV
- Size: Any size (the app handles large files)
- Quality: Any quality works
- Location: Must be in the `uploads/demo/` directory
